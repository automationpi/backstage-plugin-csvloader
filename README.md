## Getting Started

To integrate the Onboarding Tasks Plugin into your Backstage instance, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a running Backstage application. If not, follow the Backstage [Getting Started](https://backstage.io/docs/getting-started/) guide to create one.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-organization/backstage-onboarding-tasks-plugin.git plugins/onboarding-tasks

2. Add the plugin to your app's `packages/app/src/plugins.ts`:

```typescript
export { plugin as OnboardingTasks } from '@your-organization/onboarding-tasks';
```

3. Integrate the plugin component into your Backstage app, for example, by adding it to the `App.tsx` routing:

```jsx
import { OnboardingTasksPage } from '@your-organization/onboarding-tasks';

// Inside your App component's Router
<Route path="/onboarding-tasks" element={<OnboardingTasksPage />} />
```
